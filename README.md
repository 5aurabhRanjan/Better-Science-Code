# Better-Science-Code
A presentation on best coding/data management practices based on my own experiences of scientific computing and data analysis and heavily borrowing from the recommendations of many others (This is not meant to be a unique work, more like an annotated compilation of advice. See Bibliography).

## Writing better code

](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/)
* Solid practical advice for writing good code and managing data.

[Initial steps toward reproducible research - Karl Broman ](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/)
* Another good guide for writing code and managing data. More focused on R.

[10 Tips for Writing Cleaner & Better Code ](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-tips-writing-cleaner-better-code/)
* A short list of tips for those that don't have much time.

## Version control

[Git for humans - Alice Bartlett](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)
* Great introduction to the basics of `git` without getting too "into the weeds". Clearly explains the usefulness of commits and branching.

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* My preferred interface for beginning users of `git`. Uses a graphical interface rather than the command line.

[The curious coder’s guide to git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/index.html)
* A longer guide using the `git` command line interface

[Introduction to Git & the Command Line](https://sklise.com/2012/09/22/introduction-to-git/)
* A step-by-step guide to `git` and the command line

[Software Carpentry's Guide to Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* Another command line tutorial to using `git`

[Git Introduction - Chris Markiewicz](https://github.com/bu-cnso/git-introduction)
* More advanced `git` tutorial that covers how to contribute to open source projects


## How to document your code

[Numpy/Scipy Style Guide](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
* My recommended style for documenting scientific code for both Matlab and Python.

[Best practices for file naming](http://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming)
* A couple of helpful tips in naming file. Most are fairly obvious but easy to forget.


## Open science

[How I learned to stop worrying and love the coming archivability crisis in scientific software - C. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-pof-software-archivability.html)
* Critical thinking about the limits of our ability to reproduce results years later.

* Case studies of reproducible workflows used for science research

[An onboarding guide to research in my lab - trying to articulate clear standards for new projects - Michael C. Frank](http://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2017/01/onboarding.html)
* Open-science checklist for projects

* Targeted towards neuroimaging, but gives applicable advice for all of neuroscience.

* Aa policy discussion about creating incentives for reproducible science

[Millman, K.J., and Pérez, F. (2014). Developing open-source scientific practice. Implementing Reproducible Research 149.
](https://osf.io/h9gsd/)
* The introduction makes a strong case for reproducible research. Mostly focused on Python tools.
