% Coding Exercises
%
% Refactor this code by:
%     1. Turning some of the code into small well-defined, well-named
%        functions (Remember comments can often replaced by good
%        function/variable names, duplicate code should be turned into
%        functions)
%     2. Using good function and variable names
%     3. Documenting your functions using the numpy format:
%          - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/example.py
%          - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
%        This description should include:
%          - A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the
%               function name
%          - A few sentences giving an extended description
%               (optional, only if time)
%          - Parameters — Description of the function arguments, keywords
%            and their respective types
%          - Returns — Explanation of the returned values and their types
%          - Example — how to use the function (optional, only if time)
%     4. Write at least one test function for each of your small
%        well-defined, well-named functions (should return true/false
%        depending on whether the condition has been met)
%     5. If you know how to use version control, create a repository and
%        practice writing short commit messages each time you get something
%        working.
